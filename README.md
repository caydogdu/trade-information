# trade-information
A trade information service

This is a trade-information service by Cemil Aydogdu. https://github.com/caydogdu/trade-information

These are the main ability of project

    Ability to validate trades (or other products)

This project was developed with spring boot. Java 8 is required. No database was used.

There is a Product interface in project, if you want new validatable products you can implement this interface.
When you create a new Product implementation you must override **validate()** method. You can create new validators to validate.
For example **Trade** class can use 3 validators (**SpotValidator,ForwardValidator and VanillaOptionValidator**) which extends **TradeValidator**

There is a REST Service in this project.

    To validate trades POST localhost:8081/trades with body 
    [
      {
        "customer":"PLUTO1",
        "ccyPair":"EURUSD",
        "type":"Spot",
        "direction":"BUY",
        "tradeDate":"2016-0811",
        "amount1":1000000.00,
        "amount2":1120000.00,
        "rate":1.12,
        "valueDate":"2016-08-15",
        "legalEntity":"CS Zurich",
